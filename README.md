## List of helpers

### [disableBodyScroll, enableBodyScroll](./lib/body-scroll.js)

Two functions: the first one disables scroll (but saving the current scrolled state),
the second one enables the scroll and restores its state.

It's useful when one wants to disable scroll while opening sidebar and enable it while closing.

Converts camelCase string into kebab-case.

### [isInputTypeSupported](./lib/is-input-type-supported.js)

It's useful when one is dealing with old browsers.

### [deepClone](./lib/deep-clone.js)

  - decimal separator (`delimiter`): ',' (comma),
  - minus sign (`minus`): '−' (minus, U+2212).
  
It's useful when one needs to format, let's say, the cost of something.

[browsers without URL support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL).

### [getObjectPath](./lib/get-object-path.js)

It's useful when one have to work with highly nested objects and don't want to write long conditionals.
`getObjectPath(obj, 'key1.key2.key3')` and the work is done. 

### [getPlural](./lib/get-plural.js)
